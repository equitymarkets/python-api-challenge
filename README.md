# python-api-challenge

Module 6 python-api-challenge examines what it is like as you get closer to the equator. 

In WeatherPy, sleep timer is left in but commented out for faster data retreival. Repeated tests do not seem to retreive more cities 
with the timer turned on, but under certain circumstances setting it on may slightly increase city count.
